\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a named collection of \doxylink{classAnimControl}{Anim\+Control} pointers. An \doxylink{classAnimControl}{Anim\+Control} may be added to the collection by name. While an \doxylink{classAnimControl}{Anim\+Control} is associated, its reference count is maintained; associating a new \doxylink{classAnimControl}{Anim\+Control} with the same name will decrement the previous control\textquotesingle{}s reference count (and possibly delete it, unbinding its animation). 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
