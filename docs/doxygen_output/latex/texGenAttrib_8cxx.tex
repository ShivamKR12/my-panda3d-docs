Constructs a \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} that generates no stages at all.

Constructs a \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} that generates just the indicated stage.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} that corresponds to whatever the standard default properties for render attributes of this type ought to be.

Returns a new \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} just like this one, with the indicated generation mode for the given stage. If this stage already exists, its mode is replaced. Returns a new \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} just like this one, with the indicated generation mode for the given stage. If this stage already exists, its mode is replaced.

This variant also accepts constant\+\_\+value, which is only meaningful if mode is M\+\_\+constant. Returns a new \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} just like this one, with the indicated stage removed. Returns true if no stages are defined in the \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib}, false if at least one is. Returns true if there is a mode associated with the indicated stage, or false otherwise (in which case get\+\_\+transform(stage) will return M\+\_\+off). Returns the generation mode associated with the named texture stage, or M\+\_\+off if nothing is associated with the indicated stage. Returns true if the indicated \doxylink{classTextureStage}{Texture\+Stage} will have texture coordinates generated for it automatically (and thus there is no need to upload the texture coordinates encoded in the vertices). Returns the constant value associated with the named texture stage. This is only meaningful if the mode is M\+\_\+constant. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classTexGenAttrib}{Tex\+Gen\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties. Render\+Attribs that compare the same with compare\+\_\+to\+\_\+impl(), above, should return the same hash; Render\+Attribs that compare differently should return a different hash. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). This method is to be called after the \+\_\+stages map has been built up internally through some artificial means; it copies the appropriate settings to \+\_\+no\+\_\+texcoords and updates other internal cache values appropriately.
