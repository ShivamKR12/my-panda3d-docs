Returns a suitable vertex format for sending the animated vertices to the graphics backend. This is the same format as the source format, with the CPU-\/animation data elements removed.

This may only be called after the format has been registered. The return value will have been already registered. Returns a suitable vertex format for sending the animated vertices to the graphics backend. This is the same format as the source format, with the instancing columns added.

This may only be called after the format has been registered. The return value will have been already registered. Returns a new \doxylink{classGeomVertexFormat}{Geom\+Vertex\+Format} that includes all of the columns defined in either this \doxylink{classGeomVertexFormat}{Geom\+Vertex\+Format} or the other one. If any column is defined in both formats with different sizes (for instance, texcoord2 vs. texcoord3), the new format will include the larger of the two definitions.

This may only be called after both source formats have been registered. The return value will also have been already registered. Returns a modifiable pointer to the indicated array. This means duplicating it if it is shared or registered.

This may not be called once the format has been registered.

Adds the indicated format to the registry, if there is not an equivalent format already there; in either case, returns the pointer to the equivalent format now in the registry.

This must be called before a format may be used in a \doxylink{classGeom}{Geom}. After this call, you should discard the original pointer you passed in (which may or may not now be invalid) and let its reference count decrement normally; you should use only the returned value from this point on.
