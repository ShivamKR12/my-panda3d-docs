Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for rendering the ghosted collision solid that represents the previous frame\textquotesingle{}s position, for those collision nodes that indicate a velocity.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for rendering collision visualizations in wireframe. This automatically returns the appropriate state according to the setting of \+\_\+tangible.

Assumes the lock is already held.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for rendering collision visualizations for things that are neither solid nor exactly wireframe, like rays and segments.

Assumes the lock is already held.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for rendering collision visualizations in solid. This automatically returns the appropriate state according to the setting of \+\_\+tangible.

Assumes the lock is already held.

Called during draw to begin a three-\/step rendering phase to draw decals. The second step, begin\+\_\+decal\+\_\+nested(), is called after drawing the base geometry and prior to drawing any of the nested decal geometry that is to be applied to the base geometry.

Called during draw to begin a three-\/step rendering phase to draw decals. The third step, begin\+\_\+decal\+\_\+base\+\_\+second(), is called after drawing the base geometry and the nested decal geometry, and prior to drawing the base geometry one more time (if needed).

It should return a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object appropriate for rendering the base geometry the second time, or NULL if it is not necessary to re-\/render the base geometry.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for flashing the object blue, to show it is animated by the hardware when show-\/vertex-\/animation is on.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} that renders only the wireframe part of an M\+\_\+filled\+\_\+wireframe model. If a shader attrib is provided, a constant color is used in \doxylink{classColorBlendAttrib}{Color\+Blend\+Attrib} to emulate the flat color.

Recursively determines the net state changes to the indicated component node from the root of the graph. Recursively determines the net state changes to the indicated component node from the nth node above it. If n exceeds the length of the path, this returns the net transform from the root of the graph. Recursively determines the net transform to the indicated component node from the root of the graph. Recursively determines the net transform to the indicated component node from the nth node above it. If n exceeds the length of the path, this returns the net transform from the root of the graph.

If any node in the path had a net\+\_\+transform effect applied, returns NULL-- in this case the partial transform cannot be easily determined. Recursively determines the net "{}previous"{} transform to the indicated component node from the root of the graph. Recursively determines the net "{}previous"{} transform to the indicated component node from the nth node above it. If n exceeds the length of the path, this returns the net previous transform from the root of the graph. Finds up to max\+\_\+matches matches against the given path string from this node and deeper. The max\+\_\+matches count indicates the maximum number of matches to return, or -\/1 not to limit the number returned. Finds up to max\+\_\+matches matches against the given approx\+\_\+path from this node and deeper. The max\+\_\+matches count indicates the maximum number of matches to return, or -\/1 not to limit the number returned. The fundamental implementation of find\+\_\+matches(), given a starting level (a linked list of \doxylink{classFindApproxLevelEntry}{Find\+Approx\+Level\+Entry} objects). The recursive implementation of clear\+\_\+model\+\_\+nodes(). This walks through the subgraph defined by the indicated node and below.

Returns the \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} to apply to the frame.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with two attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with three attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with four attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with five attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with n attributes set.

Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the composition of this state with the other state.

The result of this operation is cached, and will be retained as long as both this \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object and the other \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object continue to exist. Should one of them destruct, the cached entry will be removed, and its pointer will be allowed to destruct as well. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the composition of this state\textquotesingle{}s inverse with the other state.

This is similar to compose(), but is particularly useful for computing the relative state of a node as viewed from some other node. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the new \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} added. If there is already a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with the same type, it is replaced (unless the override is lower). Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the new \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} added. If there is already a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with the same type, it is replaced unconditionally. The override is not changed. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the new \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} added. If there is already a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with the same type, it is replaced unconditionally. The override is also replaced unconditionally. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the indicated \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} removed. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with all attributes\textquotesingle{} override values incremented (or decremented, if negative) by the indicated amount. If the override would drop below zero, it is set to zero. This method overrides Reference\+Count\+::unref() to check whether the remaining reference count is entirely in the cache, and if so, it checks for and breaks a cycle in the cache involving this object. This is designed to prevent leaks from cyclical references within the cache. Returns the maximum priority number (sometimes called override) that may be set on any node. This may or may not be enforced, but the scene graph code assumes that no priority numbers will be larger than this, and some effects may not work properly if you use a larger number.

This function is used to share a common \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} pointer for all equivalent \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} objects.

This is different from return\+\_\+unique() in that it does not actually guarantee a unique pointer, unless uniquify-\/states is set.

This function is used to share a common \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} pointer for all equivalent \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} objects.

See the similar logic in \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}. The idea is to create a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object and pass it through this function, which will share the pointer with a previously-\/created \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object if it is equivalent.

The private implemention of compose(); this actually composes two Render\+States, without bothering with the cache. The private implemention of invert\+\_\+compose(). Detects whether there is a cycle in the cache that begins with this state. If any are detected, breaks them by removing this state from the cache.

Given an input state, returns the munged state.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for rendering the new element during first half of fade.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for rendering the old element during second half of fade.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} for rendering the new element during second half of fade.
