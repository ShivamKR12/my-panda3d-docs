Returns the fundamental rendering type of this primitive\+: whether it is points, lines, or polygons.

This is used to set up the appropriate antialiasing settings when Antialias\+Attrib\+::\+M\+\_\+auto is in effect; it also implies the type of primitive that will be produced when decompose() is called. Returns the set of Geom\+Rendering bits that represent the rendering properties required to properly render this primitive. Adds adjacency information to this primitive. May return null if this type of geometry does not support adjacency information. Returns the minimum number of vertices that must be added before close\+\_\+primitive() may legally be called. Returns the number of vertices that are added between primitives that aren\textquotesingle{}t, strictly speaking, part of the primitives themselves. This is used, for instance, to define degenerate triangles to connect otherwise disconnected triangle strips. Calls the appropriate method on the GSG to draw the primitive. Decomposes a complex primitive type into a simpler primitive type, for instance line strips to lines, and returns a pointer to the new primitive definition. If the decomposition cannot be performed, this might return the original object.

This method is useful for application code that wants to iterate through the set of lines on the primitive without having to write handlers for each possible kind of primitive type. The virtual implementation of do\+\_\+rotate(). Should be redefined to return true in any primitive that implements append\+\_\+unused\+\_\+vertices(). Called when a new primitive is begun (other than the first primitive), this should add some degenerate vertices between primitives, if the primitive type requires that. The second parameter is the first vertex that begins the new primitive.
