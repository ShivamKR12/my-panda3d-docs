Gets the node\textquotesingle{}s position and based on distance from lights in the lightgroup calculates the color to be modulated in. If the avatar is in the range of multiple lights, then determine, which light it is closer to, and get the weight of the scene\+\_\+color in respect to that light\textquotesingle{}s proximity. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classPolylightEffect}{Polylight\+Effect} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classPolylightEffect}{Polylight\+Effect} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classPolylightEffect}{Polylight\+Effect} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classPolylightEffect}{Polylight\+Effect} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Add a \doxylink{classPolylightNode}{Polylight\+Node} object to this effect and return a new effect Remove a light from this effect. Return the new updated effect Set weight and return a new effect... the reason this couldnt be done through make was because that would return a new effect without the lightgroup which is static and cant be accessed Here, we just pass that to the make Set Contrib Type and return a new effect... the reason this couldnt be done through make was because that would return a new effect without the lightgroup which is static and cant be accessed Here, we just pass that to the make Set weight and return a new effect... the reason this couldnt be done through make was because that would return a new effect without the lightgroup which is static and cant be accessed Here, we just pass that to the make Returns true if the indicated light is listed in the \doxylink{classPolylightEffect}{Polylight\+Effect}, false otherwise. \Hypertarget{polylightEffect_8cxx_a5b95be5775ddc2ef2ae098c3995c6450}\label{polylightEffect_8cxx_a5b95be5775ddc2ef2ae098c3995c6450}
