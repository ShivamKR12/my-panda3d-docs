Returns a new Panda \doxylink{classThread}{Thread} object associated with the current thread (which has been created externally). This can be used to bind a unique Panda \doxylink{classThread}{Thread} object with an external thread, such as a new Python thread.

It is particularly useful to bind a Panda \doxylink{classThread}{Thread} object to an external thread for the purposes of PStats monitoring. Without this call, each external thread will be assigned the same global \doxylink{classExternalThread}{External\+Thread} object, which means they will all appear in the same PStats graph.

It is the caller\textquotesingle{}s responsibility to save the returned \doxylink{classThread}{Thread} pointer for the lifetime of the external thread. It is an error for the \doxylink{classThread}{Thread} pointer to destruct while the external thread is still in the system.

It is also an error to call this method from the main thread, or twice within a given thread, unless it is given the same name each time (in which case the same pointer will be returned each time).
