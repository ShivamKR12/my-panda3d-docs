It goes against Panda3D coding style conventions to hide an entire class in a C++ file and not expose it through header files at all. However, in this case, these classes are so full of OS-\/specific junk that I feel it is better to hide them entirely. -\/ Josh

This code was created by studying and adapting the VDOGRAB library by Shu-\/\+Kai Yang and the video\+Input library by Theodore Watson. We owe both of them a great deal of thanks for figuring all this out. Both of their libraries have informal licenses (the "{}do whatever you want and don\textquotesingle{}t blame me"{} sort), so I think there\textquotesingle{}s not a problem using their code.
