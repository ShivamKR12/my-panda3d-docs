\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class unifies all references to the same filename, so that multiple attempts to load the same model will return the same pointer. Note that the default behavior is thus to make instances\+: use with caution. Use the copy\+\_\+subgraph() method on Node (or use Node\+Path\+::copy\+\_\+to) to make modifiable copies of the node.

Unlike \doxylink{classTexturePool}{Texture\+Pool}, this class does not automatically resolve the model filenames before loading, so a relative path and an absolute path to the same model will appear to be different filenames.

However, see the \doxylink{classLoader}{Loader} class, which is now the preferred interface for loading models. The \doxylink{classLoader}{Loader} class can resolve filenames, supports threaded loading, and can automatically consult the \doxylink{classModelPool}{Model\+Pool}, according to the supplied \doxylink{classLoaderOptions}{Loader\+Options}. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
