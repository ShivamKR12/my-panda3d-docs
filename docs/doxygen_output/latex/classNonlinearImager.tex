\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class object combines the rendered output of a 3-\/d from one or more linear (e.\+g. perspective) cameras, as seen through a single, possibly nonlinear camera.

This can be used to generate real-\/time imagery of a 3-\/d scene using a nonlinear camera, for instance a fisheye camera, even though the underlying graphics engine may only support linear cameras. It can also pre-\/distort imagery to compensate for off-\/axis projectors, and/or curved screens of any complexity.

A \doxylink{classNonlinearImager}{Nonlinear\+Imager} may be visualized as a dark room into which a number of projection screens have been placed, of arbitrary size and shape and at any arbitrary position and orientation to each other. Onto each of these screens is projected the view as seen by a normal perspective camera that exists in the world (that is, under render).

There also exist in the room one or more (possibly nonlinear) cameras, called viewers, that observe these screens. The image of the projection screens seen by each viewer is finally displayed on the viewer\textquotesingle{}s associated \doxylink{classDisplayRegion}{Display\+Region}. By placing the viewer(s) appropriately relative to the screens, and by choosing suitable lens properties for the viewer(s), you can achieve a wide variety of distortion effects.

There are several different \doxylink{classLensNode}{Lens\+Node} (\doxylink{classCamera}{Camera}) objects involved at each stage in the process. To help keep them all straight, different words are used to refer to each different kind of \doxylink{classCamera}{Camera} used within this object. The camera(s) under render, that capture the original view of the world to be projected onto the screens, are called source cameras, and are set per screen via set\+\_\+source\+\_\+camera(). The \doxylink{classLensNode}{Lens\+Node} that is associated with each screen to project the image as seen from the screen\textquotesingle{}s source camera is called a projector; these are set via the Projection\+Screen\+::set\+\_\+projector() interface. Finally, the cameras that view the whole configuration of screens are called viewers; each of these is associated with a \doxylink{classDisplayRegion}{Display\+Region}, and they are set via set\+\_\+viewer\+\_\+camera().

Of all these lenses, only the source cameras must use linear (that is, perspective or orthographic) lenses. The projectors and viewers may be any arbitrary lens, linear or otherwise.
