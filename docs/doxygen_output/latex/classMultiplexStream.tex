\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a special ostream that forwards the data that is written to it to any number of other sources, for instance other ostreams, or explicitly to a disk file or to system logging utilities. It\textquotesingle{}s a very handy thing to set \doxylink{classNotify}{Notify} to refer to when running in batch mode. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
