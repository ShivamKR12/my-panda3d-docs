\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class provides a number of convenient methods for painting drawings directly into a \doxylink{classPNMImage}{PNMImage}.

It stores a pointer to the \doxylink{classPNMImage}{PNMImage} you pass it, but it does not take ownership of the object; you are responsible for ensuring that the \doxylink{classPNMImage}{PNMImage} does not destruct during the lifetime of the \doxylink{classPNMPainter}{PNMPainter} object. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
