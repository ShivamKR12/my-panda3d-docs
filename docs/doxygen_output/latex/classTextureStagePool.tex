\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The \doxylink{classTextureStagePool}{Texture\+Stage\+Pool} (there is only one in the universe) serves to unify different pointers to the same \doxylink{classTextureStage}{Texture\+Stage}, mainly to help developers use a common pointer to access things that are loaded from different model files.

It runs in one of three different modes, according to set\+\_\+mode(). See that method for more information. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
