\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a list of pointers returned by a \doxylink{classMemoryUsage}{Memory\+Usage} object in response to some query.

Warning\+: once pointers are stored in a \doxylink{classMemoryUsagePointers}{Memory\+Usage\+Pointers} object, they are reference-\/counted, and will not be freed until the \doxylink{classMemoryUsagePointers}{Memory\+Usage\+Pointers} object is freed (or clear() is called on the object). However, they may not even be freed then; pointers may leak once they have been added to this structure. This is because we don\textquotesingle{}t store enough information in this structure to correctly free the pointers that have been added. Since this is intended primarily as a debugging tool, this is not a major issue.

This class is just a user interface to talk about pointers stored in a \doxylink{classMemoryUsage}{Memory\+Usage} object. It doesn\textquotesingle{}t even exist when compiled with NDEBUG. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
