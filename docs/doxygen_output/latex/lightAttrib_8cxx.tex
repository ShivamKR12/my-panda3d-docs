Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} object that turns on (or off, according to op) the indicated light(s).

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} that corresponds to whatever the standard default properties for render attributes of this type ought to be.

Returns a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated light added to the list of lights.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} object that does nothing.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} object that turns off all lights (and hence disables lighting).

Returns a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated light added to the list of lights turned on by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated light removed from the list of lights turned on by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated light replaced with the given other light. Returns a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated light added to the list of lights turned off by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated light removed from the list of lights turned off by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated light replaced with the given other light. Returns the most important light (that is, the light with the highest priority) in the \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib}, excluding any ambient lights. Returns an empty \doxylink{classNodePath}{Node\+Path} if no non-\/ambient lights are found. Returns the total contribution of all the ambient lights. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties. Render\+Attribs that compare the same with compare\+\_\+to\+\_\+impl(), above, should return the same hash; Render\+Attribs that compare differently should return a different hash. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). Makes sure the lights are sorted in order of priority. Also counts the number of non-\/ambient lights.
