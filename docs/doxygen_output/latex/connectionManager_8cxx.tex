Opens a socket for sending and/or receiving UDP packets. If the port number is greater than zero, the UDP connection will be opened for listening on the indicated port; otherwise, it will be useful only for sending.

Use a \doxylink{classConnectionReader}{Connection\+Reader} and \doxylink{classConnectionWriter}{Connection\+Writer} to handle the actual communication.

Opens a socket for sending and/or receiving UDP packets. If the port number is greater than zero, the UDP connection will be opened for listening on the indicated port; otherwise, it will be useful only for sending.

This variant accepts both a hostname and port to listen on a particular interface; if the hostname is empty, all interfaces will be available, both IPv4 and IPv6.

If for\+\_\+broadcast is true, this UDP connection will be configured to send and/or receive messages on the broadcast address (255.\+255.\+255.\+255); otherwise, these messages may be automatically filtered by the OS.

Use a \doxylink{classConnectionReader}{Connection\+Reader} and \doxylink{classConnectionWriter}{Connection\+Writer} to handle the actual communication.

Creates a socket to be used as a rendezvous socket for a server to listen for TCP connections. The socket returned by this call should only be added to a \doxylink{classConnectionListener}{Connection\+Listener} (not to a generic \doxylink{classConnectionReader}{Connection\+Reader}).

This variant of this method accepts a single port, and will listen to that port on all available interfaces, both IPv4 and IPv6.

backlog is the maximum length of the queue of pending connections.

Creates a socket to be used as a rendezvous socket for a server to listen for TCP connections. The socket returned by this call should only be added to a \doxylink{classConnectionListener}{Connection\+Listener} (not to a generic \doxylink{classConnectionReader}{Connection\+Reader}).

This variant of this method accepts a "{}hostname"{}, which is usually just an IP address in dotted notation, and a port number. It will listen on the interface indicated by the IP address. If the IP address is empty string, it will listen on all interfaces.

backlog is the maximum length of the queue of pending connections.

Creates a socket to be used as a rendezvous socket for a server to listen for TCP connections. The socket returned by this call should only be added to a \doxylink{classConnectionListener}{Connection\+Listener} (not to a generic \doxylink{classConnectionReader}{Connection\+Reader}).

This variant of this method accepts a \doxylink{classNetAddress}{Net\+Address}, which allows you to specify a specific interface to listen to.

backlog is the maximum length of the queue of pending connections.

Attempts to establish a TCP client connection to a server at the indicated address. If the connection is not established within timeout\+\_\+ms milliseconds, a null connection is returned.

This is a shorthand version of the function to directly establish communications to a named host and port.
