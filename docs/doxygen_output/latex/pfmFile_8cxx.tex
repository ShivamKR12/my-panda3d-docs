Computes the minmax bounding volume of the points in 3-\/D space, assuming the points represent a mostly-\/planar surface.

This algorithm works by sampling the (square) sample\+\_\+radius pixels at the four point\+\_\+dist corners around the center (cx -\/ pd, cx + pd) and so on, to approximate the plane of the surface. Then all of the points are projected into that plane and the bounding volume of the entire mesh within that plane is determined. If points\+\_\+only is true, the bounding volume of only those four points is determined.

center, point\+\_\+dist and sample\+\_\+radius are in UV space, i.\+e. in the range 0..1. Computes the average of all the point within sample\+\_\+radius (manhattan distance) and the indicated point.

The point coordinates are given in UV space, in the range 0..1. Copies a rectangular area of another image into a rectangular area of this image. Both images must already have been initialized. The upper-\/left corner of the region in both images is specified, and the size of the area; if the size is omitted, it defaults to the entire other image, or the largest piece that will fit.
