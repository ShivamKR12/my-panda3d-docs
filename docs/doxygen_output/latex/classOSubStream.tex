\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An ostream object that presents a subwindow into another ostream. The first character written to this stream will be the "{}start"{} character in the dest istream; no characters may be written to character "{}end"{} or later (unless end is zero).

The dest stream must be one that we can randomly seek within. The resulting \doxylink{classOSubStream}{OSub\+Stream} will also support arbitrary seeks. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
panda/src/express/\mbox{\hyperlink{subStream_8h}{sub\+Stream.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
