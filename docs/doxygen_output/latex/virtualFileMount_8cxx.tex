Constructs and returns a new \doxylink{classVirtualFile}{Virtual\+File} instance that corresponds to the indicated filename within this mount point. The returned \doxylink{classVirtualFile}{Virtual\+File} object does not imply that the given file actually exists; but if the file does exist, then the handle can be used to read it.

Uses the indicated search path to find the file within the file system. Returns the first occurrence of the file found, or NULL if the file cannot be found. Attempts to delete the indicated file or directory. This can remove a single file or an empty directory. It will not remove a nonempty directory. Returns true on success, false on failure.

The private implementation of get\+\_\+file(), create\+\_\+file(), and make\+\_\+directory(). Assumes the lock is already held. Evaluates one possible filename match found during a get\+\_\+file() operation. There may be multiple matches for a particular filename due to the ambiguities introduced by allowing multiple mount points, so we may have to keep searching even after the first match is found.

Returns true if the search should terminate now, or false if it should keep iterating. The indicated filename was not found. Check to see if it is using an implicit reference to a .mf file as a directory, that hasn\textquotesingle{}t already been mounted. If it is, mount the .mf file in-\/place, and return true; if it is not, or if its .mf file is already mounted in-\/place, return false.

Assumes the lock is already held.
