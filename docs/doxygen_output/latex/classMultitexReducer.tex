\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This object presents an interface for generating new texture images that represent the combined images from one or more individual textures, reproducing certain kinds of multitexture effects without depending on multitexture support in the hardware.

This also flattens out texture matrices and removes extra texture coordinates from the Geoms. It is thus not a complete substitute for true multitexturing, because it does not lend itself well to dynamic animation of the textures once they have been flattened. It is, however, useful for "{}baking in"{} a particular multitexture effect.
