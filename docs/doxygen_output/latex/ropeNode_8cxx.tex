Returns the appropriate \doxylink{classGeomVertexFormat}{Geom\+Vertex\+Format} for rendering, according to the user-\/specified requirements. Does the actual internal recompute. Draws the rope in RM\+\_\+thread mode. This uses a Geom\+Linestrip to draw the rope in the simplest possible method, generally resulting in a one-\/pixel-\/ wide curve.

In this mode, the thickness parameter represents a thickness in pixels, and is passed to the linestrip. However, you should be aware the DirectX does not support line thickness. This mode does not support per-\/vertex thickness. Draws the rope in RM\+\_\+tape mode. This draws a series of triangle strips oriented to be perpendicular to the tube\+\_\+up vector.

In this mode, thickness is in spatial units, and determines the width of the triangle strips. Draws the rope in RM\+\_\+billboard mode. This draws a series of triangle strips oriented to be perpendicular to the camera plane.

In this mode, thickness is in spatial units, and determines the width of the triangle strips. Draws the rope in RM\+\_\+tube mode. This draws a hollow tube centered around the string.

In this mode, thickness is in spatial units, and determines the diameter of the tube. Evaluates the string of vertices along the curve, and also breaks them up into connected segments.

Since the \doxylink{classNurbsCurveEvaluator}{Nurbs\+Curve\+Evaluator} describes the curve as a sequence of possibly-\/connected piecewise continuous segments, this means joining together some adjacent segments from the \doxylink{classNurbsCurveEvaluator}{Nurbs\+Curve\+Evaluator} into a single Curve\+Segment, if they happen to be connected (as most will be).

The return value is the total number of points across all segments. Calculates the vertices for a RM\+\_\+thread render. This just copies the vertices more-\/or-\/less directly into the array. Calculates the vertices for a RM\+\_\+billboard render. This puts a pair of vertices on either side of each computed point in curve\+\_\+segments. Calculates the vertices for a RM\+\_\+tube render. This puts a ring of vertices around each computed point in curve\+\_\+segments. Computes the tangent to the curve at the indicated point in the segment.
