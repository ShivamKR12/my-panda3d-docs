\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a special ostream that writes to a memory buffer, like ostrstream. However, its contents can be continuously extracted as a sequence of lines of text.

Unlike ostrstream, which can only be extracted from once (and then the buffer freezes and it can no longer be written to), the \doxylink{classLineStream}{Line\+Stream} is not otherwise affected when a line of text is extracted. More text can still be written to it and continuously extracted. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
dtool/src/dtoolutil/\mbox{\hyperlink{lineStream_8h}{line\+Stream.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
