Evicts the page from the LRU. Called internally when the LRU determines that it is full. May also be called externally when necessary to explicitly evict the page.

It is legal for this method to either evict the page as requested, do nothing (in which case the eviction will be requested again at the next epoch), or requeue itself on the tail of the queue (in which case the eviction will be requested again much later).

Resets the texture object to a new one so a new GL texture object can be uploaded. This call also allows the texture target to be changed.

Returns an implementation-\/defined handle or pointer that can be used to interface directly with the underlying API. Returns 0 if the underlying implementation does not support this. Similar to get\+\_\+native\+\_\+id, but some implementations use a separate identifier for the buffer object associated with buffer textures. Returns 0 if the underlying implementation does not support this, or if this is not a buffer texture. Changes the number of views in the texture.

Returns true if the texture needs a barrier before a read or write of the given kind. If writing is false, only writes are synced, otherwise both reads and writes are synced.

Mark a texture as needing a memory barrier, since an unsynchronized read or write just happened to it. If \textquotesingle{}wrote\textquotesingle{} is true, it was written to.

Returns a PBO with the given size to the pool of unused PBOs.

Deletes all unused PBOs.
