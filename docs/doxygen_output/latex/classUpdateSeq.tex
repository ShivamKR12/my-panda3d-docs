\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a sequence number that increments monotonically. It can be used to track cache updates, or serve as a kind of timestamp for any changing properties.

A special class is used instead of simply an int, so we can elegantly handle such things as wraparound and special cases. There are two special cases. Firstly, a sequence number is \textquotesingle{}initial\textquotesingle{} when it is first created. This sequence is older than any other sequence number. Secondly, a sequence number may be explicitly set to \textquotesingle{}old\textquotesingle{}. This is older than any other sequence number except \textquotesingle{}initial\textquotesingle{}. Finally, we have the explicit number \textquotesingle{}fresh\textquotesingle{}, which is newer than any other sequence number. All other sequences are numeric and are monotonically increasing. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}

panda/src/putil/\mbox{\hyperlink{updateSeq_8h}{update\+Seq.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
