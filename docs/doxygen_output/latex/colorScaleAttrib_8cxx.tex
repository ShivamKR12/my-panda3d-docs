Constructs an identity scale attrib.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} object that indicates geometry should be scaled by the indicated factor.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} object that ignores any \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} inherited from above. You may also specify an additional color scale to apply to geometry below (using set\+\_\+scale()).

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} that corresponds to whatever the standard default properties for render attributes of this type ought to be.

Returns a new \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the scale changed to the indicated value. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return false if a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} on a higher node will compose into a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} on a lower node that has a higher override value, or false if the lower \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} will completely replace the state.

The default behavior is false\+: normally, a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} in the graph cannot completely override a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} above it, regardless of its override value--instead, the two attribs are composed. But for some kinds of Render\+Attribs, it is useful to allow this kind of override.

This method only handles the one special case of a lower \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with a higher override value. If the higher \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} has a higher override value, it always completely overrides. And if both Render\+Attribs have the same override value, they are always composed. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties. Render\+Attribs that compare the same with compare\+\_\+to\+\_\+impl(), above, should return the same hash; Render\+Attribs that compare differently should return a different hash. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). Quantizes the color scale to the nearest multiple of 1024, just to prevent runaway accumulation of only slightly-\/different Color\+Scale\+Attribs.
