Constructs a new \doxylink{classRenderModeAttrib}{Render\+Mode\+Attrib} object that specifies whether to draw polygons in the normal, filled mode, or wireframe mode, or in some other yet-\/to-\/be-\/defined mode.

The thickness parameter specifies the thickness to be used for wireframe lines, as well as for ordinary linestrip lines; it also specifies the diameter of points. (Thick lines are presently only supported in Open\+GL; but thick points are supported on either platform.)

If perspective is true, the point thickness represented is actually a width in 3-\/d units, and the points should scale according to perspective. When it is false, the point thickness is actually a width in pixels, and points are a uniform screen size regardless of distance from the camera.

In M\+\_\+filled\+\_\+wireframe mode, you should also specify the wireframe\+\_\+color, indicating the flat color to assign to the overlayed wireframe.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} that corresponds to whatever the standard default properties for render attributes of this type ought to be.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Tells the \doxylink{classBamReader}{Bam\+Reader} how to create objects of type \doxylink{classRenderModeAttrib}{Render\+Mode\+Attrib}.
