\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
An istream object that presents a subwindow into another istream. The first character read from this stream will be the "{}start"{} character from the source istream; just before the file pointer reaches the "{}end"{} character, eof is returned.

The source stream must be one that we can randomly seek within. The resulting \doxylink{classISubStream}{ISub\+Stream} will also support arbitrary seeks. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
panda/src/express/\mbox{\hyperlink{subStream_8h}{sub\+Stream.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
