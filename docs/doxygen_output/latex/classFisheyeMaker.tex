\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class is similar to \doxylink{classCardMaker}{Card\+Maker}, but instead of generating ordinary cards, it generates a circular rose that represents the projection of a 3-\/D scene through a fisheye lens. The texture coordinates of the rose are defined so that each 2-\/D vertex has a 3-\/D UVW that reflects the corresponding position in 3-\/D space of that particular vertex.

This class is particularly suited for converting cube maps to sphere maps. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
