Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightRampAttrib}{Light\+Ramp\+Attrib} object. This is the standard Open\+GL lighting ramp, which clamps the final light total to the 0-\/1 range.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightRampAttrib}{Light\+Ramp\+Attrib} object. This differs from the usual Open\+GL lighting model in that it does not clamp the final lighting total to (0,1).

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightRampAttrib}{Light\+Ramp\+Attrib} object. This causes the luminance of the diffuse lighting contribution to be quantized using a single threshold\+:

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightRampAttrib}{Light\+Ramp\+Attrib} object. This causes the luminance of the diffuse lighting contribution to be quantized using two thresholds\+:

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightRampAttrib}{Light\+Ramp\+Attrib} object. This causes an HDR tone mapping operation to be applied.

Normally, brightness values greater than 1 cannot be distinguished from each other, causing very brightly lit objects to wash out white and all detail to be erased. HDR tone mapping remaps brightness values in the range 0-\/infinity into the range (0,1), making it possible to distinguish detail in scenes whose brightness exceeds 1.

However, the monitor has finite contrast. Normally, all of that contrast is used to represent brightnesses in the range 0-\/1. The HDR0 tone mapping operator \textquotesingle{}steals\textquotesingle{} one quarter of that contrast to represent brightnesses in the range 1-\/infinity.
