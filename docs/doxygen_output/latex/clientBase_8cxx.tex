Returns a \doxylink{classClientDevice}{Client\+Device} pointer that corresponds to the named device of the indicated device type. The device\+\_\+type should be one of \doxylink{classClientTrackerDevice}{Client\+Tracker\+Device}, \doxylink{classClientAnalogDevice}{Client\+Analog\+Device}, etc.; the device\+\_\+name is implementation defined.

Normally, the user does not need to call this function directly; it is called automatically by creating a \doxylink{classTrackerNode}{Tracker\+Node} or \doxylink{classAnalogNode}{Analog\+Node} or some such data graph node.

The return value is the pointer to the created device (which might be the same pointer returned by a previous call to this function with the same parameters). When the pointer destructs (i.\+e. its reference count reaches zero) it will automatically be disconnected.

If the named device does not exist or cannot be connected for some reason, NULL is returned.

Creates a new tracker device. The device\+\_\+name is parsed for sensor and data\+\_\+type information.

The device\+\_\+name may be one of the following\+:

tracker\+\_\+name tracker\+\_\+name\+:N tracker\+\_\+name\+:N\mbox{[}pva\mbox{]}

Where N is an integer sensor number, and \mbox{[}pva\mbox{]} is one of the lowercase letters p, v, or a.

In the first form, the device connects to the indicated tracker, and reports position information on sensor number 0.

In the second form, the device connects to the indicated tracker, and reports position information on the indicated sensor number.

In the third form, the device connects to the indicated tracker, and reports either position, velocity, or acceleration information on the indicated sensor number.

Creates a new button device. The device\+\_\+name is sent verbatim to the VRPN library.

Creates a new analog device. The device\+\_\+name is sent verbatim to the VRPN library.

Creates a new dial device. The device\+\_\+name is sent verbatim to the VRPN library.
