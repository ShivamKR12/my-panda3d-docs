\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class is intended to be the base class of all objects in Panda that might be allocated and deleted via the new and delete operators. It redefines these operators to provide some memory tracking support.

We used to try to override the global operator new and delete methods, but that seems to cause problems when including header files for C++-\/based system libraries (such as are found on OSX). 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
dtool/src/dtoolbase/\mbox{\hyperlink{memoryBase_8h}{memory\+Base.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
