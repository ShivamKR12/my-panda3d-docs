This function is used by derived \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect} types to share a common \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect} pointer for all equivalent \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect} objects.

The make() function of the derived type should create a new \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect} and pass it through return\+\_\+new(), which will either save the pointer and return it unchanged (if this is the first similar such object) or delete it and return an equivalent pointer (if there was already a similar object saved). \Hypertarget{renderEffect_8cxx_a34a750fc982d2e427565af16a8f2f7b9}\label{renderEffect_8cxx_a34a750fc982d2e427565af16a8f2f7b9}

Preprocesses the accumulated transform that is about to be applied to (or through) this node due to a flatten operation. The returned value will be used instead. Returns true if this kind of effect can safely be combined with sibling nodes that share the exact same effect, or false if this is not a good idea. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect} transformed by the indicated matrix. Should be overridden by derived classes to return true if cull\+\_\+callback() has been defined. Otherwise, returns false to indicate cull\+\_\+callback() does not need to be called for this effect during the cull traversal. If has\+\_\+cull\+\_\+callback() returns true, this function will be called during the cull traversal to perform any additional operations that should be performed at cull time. This may include additional manipulation of render state or additional visible/invisible decisions, or any other arbitrary operation.

At the time this function is called, the current node\textquotesingle{}s transform and state have not yet been applied to the net\+\_\+transform and net\+\_\+state. This callback may modify the node\+\_\+transform and node\+\_\+state to apply an effective change to the render state at this level. Should be overridden by derived classes to return true if adjust\+\_\+transform() has been defined, and therefore the \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect} has some effect on the node\textquotesingle{}s apparent local and net transforms. Performs some operation on the node\textquotesingle{}s apparent net and/or local transforms. This will only be called if has\+\_\+adjust\+\_\+transform() is redefined to return true.

Both parameters are in/out. The original transforms will be passed in, and they may (or may not) be modified in-\/place by the \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect}. Returns the total number of unique \doxylink{classRenderEffect}{Render\+Effect} objects allocated in the world. This will go up and down during normal operations.
