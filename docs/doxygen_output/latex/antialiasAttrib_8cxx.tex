Constructs a new \doxylink{classAntialiasAttrib}{Antialias\+Attrib} object.

The mode should be either M\+\_\+none, M\+\_\+auto, or a union of any or all of M\+\_\+point, M\+\_\+line, M\+\_\+polygon, and M\+\_\+multisample. Also, in addition to the above choices, it may include either of M\+\_\+better of M\+\_\+faster to specify a performance/quality tradeoff hint.

If M\+\_\+none is specified, no antialiasing is performed.

If M\+\_\+multisample is specified, it means to use the special framebuffer multisample bits for antialiasing, if it is available. If so, the M\+\_\+point, M\+\_\+line, and M\+\_\+polygon modes are ignored. This advanced antialiasing mode is only available on certain graphics hardware. If it is not available, the M\+\_\+multisample bit is ignored (and the other modes may be used instead, if specified).

M\+\_\+point, M\+\_\+line, and/or M\+\_\+polygon specify per-\/primitive smoothing. When enabled, M\+\_\+point and M\+\_\+line may force transparency on. M\+\_\+polygon requires a frame buffer that includes an alpha channel, and it works best if the primitives are sorted front-\/to-\/back.

If M\+\_\+auto is specified, M\+\_\+multisample is selected if it is available, otherwise M\+\_\+polygon is selected, unless drawing lines or points, in which case M\+\_\+line or M\+\_\+point is selected (these two generally produce better results than M\+\_\+multisample)

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} that corresponds to whatever the standard default properties for render attributes of this type ought to be.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Tells the \doxylink{classBamReader}{Bam\+Reader} how to create objects of type \doxylink{classAntialiasAttrib}{Antialias\+Attrib}.
