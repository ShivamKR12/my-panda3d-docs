\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class automatically extracts the contents of a \doxylink{classMultifile}{Multifile} to the current directory (or to a specified directory) in the background.

It is designed to limit its use of system resources and run unobtrusively in the background. After specifying the files you wish to extract via repeated calls to request\+\_\+subfile(), begin the process by calling run() repeatedly. Each call to run() extracts another small portion of the \doxylink{classMultifile}{Multifile}. Call run() whenever you have spare cycles until run() returns EU\+\_\+success. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
