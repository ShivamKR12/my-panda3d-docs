Constructs a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} object suitable for rendering the indicated texture onto geometry, using the default \doxylink{classTextureStage}{Texture\+Stage}.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} object suitable for rendering untextured geometry.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} object that does nothing.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} object that turns off all stages (and hence disables texturing).

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} that corresponds to whatever the standard default properties for render attributes of this type ought to be.

Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated stage added to the list of stages turned on by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated stage added to the list of stages turned on by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated stage removed from the list of stages turned on by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated stage added to the list of stages turned off by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated stage removed from the list of stages turned off by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with any included Texture\+Attribs that happen to have the same name as the given object replaced with the object. Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with all references to the given texture replaced with the new texture.

As of Panda3D 1.\+10.\+13, new\+\_\+tex may be null to remove the texture.

\begin{DoxySince}{Since}
1.\+10.\+4 Returns a new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}, very much like this one, but with the number of on\+\_\+stages reduced to be no more than max\+\_\+texture\+\_\+stages. The number of off\+\_\+stages in the new \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} is undefined. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.
\end{DoxySince}
This should return false if a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} on a higher node will compose into a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} on a lower node that has a higher override value, or false if the lower \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} will completely replace the state.

The default behavior is false\+: normally, a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} in the graph cannot completely override a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} above it, regardless of its override value--instead, the two attribs are composed. But for some kinds of Render\+Attribs, it is useful to allow this kind of override.

This method only handles the one special case of a lower \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with a higher override value. If the higher \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} has a higher override value, it always completely overrides. And if both Render\+Attribs have the same override value, they are always composed. Should be overridden by derived classes to return true if cull\+\_\+callback() has been defined. Otherwise, returns false to indicate cull\+\_\+callback() does not need to be called for this node during the cull traversal. If has\+\_\+cull\+\_\+callback() returns true, this function will be called during the cull traversal to perform any additional operations that should be performed at cull time.

This is called each time the \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} is discovered applied to a \doxylink{classGeom}{Geom} in the traversal. It should return true if the \doxylink{classGeom}{Geom} is visible, false if it should be omitted. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties. Render\+Attribs that compare the same with compare\+\_\+to\+\_\+impl(), above, should return the same hash; Render\+Attribs that compare differently should return a different hash. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). Tells the \doxylink{classBamReader}{Bam\+Reader} how to create objects of type \doxylink{classTextureAttrib}{Texture\+Attrib}.
