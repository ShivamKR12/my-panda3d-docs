Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} suitable for enabling the material indicated by the given \doxylink{classEggMaterial}{Egg\+Material}, and with the indicated backface flag.

Applies the texture matrix from the indicated egg texture to the given \doxylink{classTexMatrixAttrib}{Tex\+Matrix\+Attrib}, and returns the new attrib.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} that corresponds to whatever the standard default properties for render attributes of this type ought to be.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Tells the \doxylink{classBamReader}{Bam\+Reader} how to create objects of type \doxylink{classAntialiasAttrib}{Antialias\+Attrib}.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib} object that indicates audio volume should be scaled by the indicated factor.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib} object that ignores any \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib} inherited from above. You may also specify an additional volume scale to apply to geometry below (using set\+\_\+volume()).

Returns a new \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the volume changed to the indicated value. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties. Render\+Attribs that compare the same with compare\+\_\+to\+\_\+impl(), above, should return the same hash; Render\+Attribs that compare differently should return a different hash. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). Tells the \doxylink{classBamReader}{Bam\+Reader} how to create objects of type \doxylink{classAudioVolumeAttrib}{Audio\+Volume\+Attrib}.

Constructs a specified \doxylink{classAuxBitplaneAttrib}{Aux\+Bitplane\+Attrib} object.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} object that turns on (or off, according to op) the indicate plane(s).

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Deprecated}

\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{deprecated__deprecated000033}{Deprecated}}]Use add\+\_\+on\+\_\+plane() or add\+\_\+off\+\_\+plane() instead. \end{DoxyRefDesc}


Returns a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated plane added to the list of planes.

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Deprecated}
\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{deprecated__deprecated000038}{Deprecated}}]Use add\+\_\+on\+\_\+plane() or add\+\_\+off\+\_\+plane() instead. \end{DoxyRefDesc}

Constructs a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} object that does nothing.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} object that disables all planes (and hence disables clipping).

Returns a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated plane added to the list of planes enabled by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated plane removed from the list of planes enabled by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated plane added to the list of planes disabled by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the indicated plane removed from the list of planes disabled by this attrib. Returns a new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib}, very much like this one, but with the number of on\+\_\+planes reduced to be no more than max\+\_\+clip\+\_\+planes. The number of off\+\_\+planes in the new \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} is undefined. This is a special method which composes two Clip\+Plane\+Attribs with regard only to their set of "{}off"{} clip planes, for the purposes of deriving Panda\+Node\+::get\+\_\+off\+\_\+clip\+\_\+planes().

The result will be a \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} that represents the union of all of the clip planes turned off in either attrib. The set of on planes in the result is undefined and should be ignored. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classClipPlaneAttrib}{Clip\+Plane\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties. Render\+Attribs that compare the same with compare\+\_\+to\+\_\+impl(), above, should return the same hash; Render\+Attribs that compare differently should return a different hash. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). This is patterned after Texture\+Attrib\+::sort\+\_\+on\+\_\+stages(), but since plane\+Nodes don\textquotesingle{}t actually require sorting, this only empties the \+\_\+filtered map.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorAttrib}{Color\+Attrib} object that indicates geometry should be rendered in the indicated color.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorAttrib}{Color\+Attrib} object that indicates geometry should be rendered in white.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorBlendAttrib}{Color\+Blend\+Attrib} object.

\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Deprecated}
\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{deprecated__deprecated000040}{Deprecated}}]Use the three-\/ or four-\/parameter constructor instead. \end{DoxyRefDesc}


Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorBlendAttrib}{Color\+Blend\+Attrib} object that enables special-\/effect blending. This supercedes transparency. The given mode and operands are used for both the RGB and alpha channels.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorBlendAttrib}{Color\+Blend\+Attrib} object that enables special-\/effect blending. This supercedes transparency. This form is used to specify separate blending parameters for the RGB and alpha channels.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} object that indicates geometry should be scaled by the indicated factor.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} object that ignores any \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} inherited from above. You may also specify an additional color scale to apply to geometry below (using set\+\_\+scale()).

Returns a new \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib}, just like this one, but with the scale changed to the indicated value. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return false if a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} on a higher node will compose into a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} on a lower node that has a higher override value, or false if the lower \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} will completely replace the state.

The default behavior is false\+: normally, a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} in the graph cannot completely override a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} above it, regardless of its override value--instead, the two attribs are composed. But for some kinds of Render\+Attribs, it is useful to allow this kind of override.

This method only handles the one special case of a lower \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with a higher override value. If the higher \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} has a higher override value, it always completely overrides. And if both Render\+Attribs have the same override value, they are always composed. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classColorScaleAttrib}{Color\+Scale\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties. Render\+Attribs that compare the same with compare\+\_\+to\+\_\+impl(), above, should return the same hash; Render\+Attribs that compare differently should return a different hash. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied. In most cases, the result is the same as the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (that is, a subsequent \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} completely replaces the preceding one). On the other hand, some kinds of \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} (for instance, Color\+Transform\+Attrib) might combine in meaningful ways. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). Quantizes the color scale to the nearest multiple of 1024, just to prevent runaway accumulation of only slightly-\/different Color\+Scale\+Attribs.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classCullFaceAttrib}{Cull\+Face\+Attrib} object that reverses the effects of any other \doxylink{classCullFaceAttrib}{Cull\+Face\+Attrib} objects in the scene graph. M\+\_\+cull\+\_\+clockwise will be treated as M\+\_\+cull\+\_\+counter\+\_\+clockwise, and vice-\/versa. M\+\_\+cull\+\_\+none is unchanged.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

See invert\+\_\+compose() and compose\+\_\+impl(). Tells the \doxylink{classBamReader}{Bam\+Reader} how to create objects of type \doxylink{classDepthBiasAttrib}{Depth\+Bias\+Attrib}.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classDepthOffsetAttrib}{Depth\+Offset\+Attrib} object that indicates the bias, and also specifies a minimum and maximum (or, more precisely, nearest and farthest) values to write to the depth buffer, in the range 0 .. 1. This range is 0, 1 by default; setting it to some other range can be used to create additional depth buffer effects.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to specify how two consecutive \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} objects of the same type interact.

This should return the result of applying the other \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} to a node in the scene graph below this \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}, which was already applied.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classLightAttrib}{Light\+Attrib} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} types to return a unique hash for these particular properties.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightRampAttrib}{Light\+Ramp\+Attrib} object. This causes an HDR tone mapping operation to be applied.

Normally, brightness values greater than 1 cannot be distinguished from each other, causing very brightly lit objects to wash out white and all detail to be erased. HDR tone mapping remaps brightness values in the range 0-\/infinity into the range (0,1), making it possible to distinguish detail in scenes whose brightness exceeds 1.

However, the monitor has finite contrast. Normally, all of that contrast is used to represent brightnesses in the range 0-\/1. The HDR0 tone mapping operator \textquotesingle{}steals\textquotesingle{} one quarter of that contrast to represent brightnesses in the range 1-\/infinity.

Constructs a new \doxylink{classLightRampAttrib}{Light\+Ramp\+Attrib} object. This causes an HDR tone mapping operation to be applied.

Normally, brightness values greater than 1 cannot be distinguished from each other, causing very brightly lit objects to wash out white and all detail to be erased. HDR tone mapping remaps brightness values in the range 0-\/infinity into the range (0,1), making it possible to distinguish detail in scenes whose brightness exceeds 1.

However, the monitor has finite contrast. Normally, all of that contrast is used to represent brightnesses in the range 0-\/1. The HDR1 tone mapping operator \textquotesingle{}steals\textquotesingle{} one third of that contrast to represent brightnesses in the range 1-\/infinity.

Set auto shader with bitmask to customize use, e.\+g., to keep normal, glow, etc., on or off Returns a new \doxylink{classShaderAttrib}{Shader\+Attrib} with the given shader inputs set. This is a more efficient way to set multiple shader inputs than calling set\+\_\+shader\+\_\+input multiple times. Sets the geometry instance count. Do not confuse this with instance\+To, which is used for animation instancing, and has nothing to do with this. A value of 0 means not to use instancing at all.

Assertion fails if there is none, or if it is not a \doxylink{classShaderBuffer}{Shader\+Buffer}. Returns the shader object associated with the node.

Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classShaderAttrib}{Shader\+Attrib} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classShaderAttrib}{Shader\+Attrib} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classShaderAttrib}{Shader\+Attrib} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.
