Hello, all future Panda audio code people! This is my errata documentation to help any future programmer maintain FMOD and PANDA.

This documentation more then that is needed, but I wanted to go all out, with the documentation. Because I was a totally newbie at programming \mbox{[}especially with C/\+C++\mbox{]} this semester I want to make sure future code maintainers have that insight I did not when starting on the PANDA project here at the ETC/\+CMU.

As of Spring 2006, Panda\textquotesingle{}s FMOD audio support has been pretty much completely rewritten. This has been done so PANDA can use FMOD-\/\+EX \mbox{[}or AKA FMOD 4\mbox{]} and some of its new features.

First, the FMOD-\/\+EX API itself has been completely rewritten compared to previous versions. FMOD now handles any type of audio files, wave audio \mbox{[}WAV, AIF, MP3, OGG, etc...\mbox{]} or musical file \mbox{[}MID, TRACKERS\mbox{]} as the same type of an object. The API has also been structured more like a sound studio, with \textquotesingle{}sounds\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}channels\textquotesingle{}. This will be covered more in the Fmod\+Audio\+Sound.\+h/.cxx sources.

Second, FMOD now offers virtually unlimited sounds to be played at once via their virtual channels system. Actually the theoretical limit is around 4000, but that is still a lot. What you need to know about this, is that even thought you might only hear 32 sound being played at once, FMOD will keep playing any additional sounds, and swap those on virtual channels in and out with those on real channels depending on priority, or distance \mbox{[}if you are dealing with 3D audio\mbox{]}.

Third, FMOD\textquotesingle{}s DSP support has been added. So you can now add GLOBAL or SOUND specific DSP effects. Right not you can only use FMOD\textquotesingle{}s built in DSP effects. But adding support for FMOD\textquotesingle{}s support of VST effects shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be that hard.

As for the Fmod\+Manager itself, it is pretty straight forward, I hope. As a manager class, it will create the FMOD system with the "{}\+\_\+system"{} variable which is an instance of FMOD\+::\+SYSTEM. (Actually, we create only one global \+\_\+system variable now, and share it with all outstanding Fmod\+Manager objects--this appears to be the way FMOD wants to work.) The Fmod\+Manager class is also the one responsible for creation of Sounds, DSP, and maintaining the GLOBAL DSP chains \mbox{[}The GLOBAL DSP chain is the DSP Chain which affects ALL the sounds\mbox{]}.

Any way that is it for an intro, lets move on to looking at the rest of the code.
