Clears the entire framebuffer before rendering, according to the settings of get\+\_\+color\+\_\+clear\+\_\+active() and get\+\_\+depth\+\_\+clear\+\_\+active() (inherited from \doxylink{classDrawableRegion}{Drawable\+Region}).

This function is called only within the draw thread.

This function will be called within the draw thread before beginning rendering for a given frame. It should do whatever setup is required, and return true if the frame should be rendered, or false if it should be skipped.

Calls \textquotesingle{}gl\+Check\+Framebuffer\+Status\textquotesingle{}. On error, prints out an appropriate error message and unbinds the fbo. Returns true for OK or false for error.

This function will be called within the draw thread to allocate/reallocate the fbo and all the associated renderbuffers, just before rendering a frame.

Attaches either a texture or a renderbuffer to the specified bitplane.

Attaches incoming \doxylink{classTexture}{Texture} or renderbuffer to the required bitplanes for the 2 FBOs comprising a multisample graphics buffer.

This function attaches the given texture to the given attachment point.

This function will be called within the draw thread after rendering is completed for a given frame. If we\textquotesingle{}ve just rendered into level zero of a mipmapped texture, then all subsequent mipmap levels will now be calculated.

This function will be called within the draw thread after rendering is completed for a given frame. It should do whatever finalization is required.

Called internally when the window is in render-\/to-\/a-\/texture mode and we are in the process of rendering the six faces of a cube map, or any other multi-\/page texture. This should do whatever needs to be done to switch the buffer to the indicated page.

Opens the window right now. Called from the window thread. Returns true if the window is successfully opened, or false if there was a problem.

This is normally called only from within make\+\_\+texture\+\_\+buffer(). When called on a \doxylink{classParasiteBuffer}{Parasite\+Buffer}, it returns the host of that buffer; but when called on some other buffer, it returns the buffer itself.

Closes the buffer right now. Called from the window thread.

Will attempt to use the depth buffer of the input graphics\+\_\+output. The buffer sizes must be exactly the same.

Discontinue sharing the depth buffer.

Returns true if this particular \doxylink{classGraphicsOutput}{Graphics\+Output} can render directly into a texture, or false if it must always copy-\/to-\/texture at the end of each frame to achieve this effect. Register/save who is sharing the depth buffer.

Unregister who is sharing the depth buffer.

If the host window has been closed, then this buffer is dead too.

After the frame has been rendered into the multisample buffer, filters it down into the final render buffer.
