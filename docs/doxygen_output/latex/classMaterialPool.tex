\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The \doxylink{classMaterialPool}{Material\+Pool} (there is only one in the universe) serves to unify different pointers to the same \doxylink{classMaterial}{Material}, so we do not (a) waste memory with many different \doxylink{classMaterial}{Material} objects that are all equivalent, and (b) waste time switching the graphics engine between different \doxylink{classMaterial}{Material} states that are really the same thing.

The idea is to create a temporary \doxylink{classMaterial}{Material} representing the lighting state you want to apply, then call get\+\_\+material(), passing in your temporary \doxylink{classMaterial}{Material}. The return value will either be a new \doxylink{classMaterial}{Material} object, or it may be the the same object you supplied; in either case, it will have the same value. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
