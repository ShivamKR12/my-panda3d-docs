This package contains the animation channels. This defines the various kinds of Anim\+Channels that may be defined, as well as the \doxylink{classMovingPart}{Moving\+Part} class which binds to the channels and plays the animation. This is a support library for char, as well as any other libraries that want to define objects whose values change over time.
