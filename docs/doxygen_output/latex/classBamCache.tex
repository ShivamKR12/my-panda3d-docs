\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class maintains a cache of Bam and/or Txo objects generated from model files and texture images (as well as possibly other kinds of loadable objects that can be stored in bam file format).

This class also maintains a persistent index that lists all of the cached objects (see \doxylink{classBamCacheIndex}{Bam\+Cache\+Index}). We go through some considerable effort to make sure this index gets saved correctly to disk, even in the presence of multiple different processes writing to the same index, and without relying too heavily on low-\/level os-\/provided file locks (which work poorly with C++ iostreams). 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
panda/src/putil/\mbox{\hyperlink{bamCache_8h}{bam\+Cache.\+h}}\item 
panda/src/putil/\mbox{\hyperlink{bamCache_8cxx}{bam\+Cache.\+cxx}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
