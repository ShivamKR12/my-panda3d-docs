Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with one attribute set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with two attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with three attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with four attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with five attributes set.

Returns a \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} with n attributes set.

Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the composition of this state with the other state.

The result of this operation is cached, and will be retained as long as both this \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object and the other \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object continue to exist. Should one of them destruct, the cached entry will be removed, and its pointer will be allowed to destruct as well. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the composition of this state\textquotesingle{}s inverse with the other state.

This is similar to compose(), but is particularly useful for computing the relative state of a node as viewed from some other node. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the new \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} added. If there is already a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with the same type, it is replaced (unless the override is lower). Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the new \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} added. If there is already a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with the same type, it is replaced unconditionally. The override is not changed. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the new \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} added. If there is already a \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} with the same type, it is replaced unconditionally. The override is also replaced unconditionally. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with the indicated \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib} removed. Returns a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object that represents the same as the source state, with all attributes\textquotesingle{} override values incremented (or decremented, if negative) by the indicated amount. If the override would drop below zero, it is set to zero. This method overrides Reference\+Count\+::unref() to check whether the remaining reference count is entirely in the cache, and if so, it checks for and breaks a cycle in the cache involving this object. This is designed to prevent leaks from cyclical references within the cache. Returns the maximum priority number (sometimes called override) that may be set on any node. This may or may not be enforced, but the scene graph code assumes that no priority numbers will be larger than this, and some effects may not work properly if you use a larger number.

This function is used to share a common \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} pointer for all equivalent \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} objects.

This is different from return\+\_\+unique() in that it does not actually guarantee a unique pointer, unless uniquify-\/states is set.

This function is used to share a common \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} pointer for all equivalent \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} objects.

See the similar logic in \doxylink{classRenderAttrib}{Render\+Attrib}. The idea is to create a new \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object and pass it through this function, which will share the pointer with a previously-\/created \doxylink{classRenderState}{Render\+State} object if it is equivalent.

The private implemention of compose(); this actually composes two Render\+States, without bothering with the cache. The private implemention of invert\+\_\+compose(). Detects whether there is a cycle in the cache that begins with this state. If any are detected, breaks them by removing this state from the cache.
