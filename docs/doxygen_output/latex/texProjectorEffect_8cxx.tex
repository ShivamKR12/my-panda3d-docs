Constructs a \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} that modifies no stages at all.

Returns a new \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} just like this one, with the indicated projection for the given stage. If this stage already exists, its projection definition is replaced.

The relative transform between the "{}from"{} and the "{}to"{} nodes is automatically applied to the texture transform each frame.

Furthermore, if the "{}to"{} node is a \doxylink{classLensNode}{Lens\+Node}, its projection matrix is also applied to the texture transform. In this case, the lens\+\_\+index may be used to select the particular lens that should be used. Returns a new \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} just like this one, with the indicated stage removed. Returns true if no stages are defined in the \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect}, false if at least one is. Returns true if there is a transform associated with the indicated stage, or false otherwise (in which case get\+\_\+transform(stage) will return the identity transform). Returns the "{}from"{} node associated with the \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} on the indicated stage. The relative transform between the "{}from"{} and the "{}to"{} nodes is automatically applied to the texture transform each frame. Returns the "{}to"{} node associated with the \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} on the indicated stage. The relative transform between the "{}from"{} and the "{}to"{} nodes is automatically applied to the texture transform each frame.

Furthermore, if the "{}to"{} node is a \doxylink{classLensNode}{Lens\+Node}, its projection matrix is also applied to the texture transform. Returns the lens\+\_\+index associated with the \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} on the indicated stage. This is only used if the "{}to"{} node is a \doxylink{classLensNode}{Lens\+Node}, in which case it specifies the particular lens that should be used. Should be overridden by derived classes to return true if cull\+\_\+callback() has been defined. Otherwise, returns false to indicate cull\+\_\+callback() does not need to be called for this effect during the cull traversal. If has\+\_\+cull\+\_\+callback() returns true, this function will be called during the cull traversal to perform any additional operations that should be performed at cull time. This may include additional manipulation of render state or additional visible/invisible decisions, or any other arbitrary operation.

At the time this function is called, the current node\textquotesingle{}s transform and state have not yet been applied to the net\+\_\+transform and net\+\_\+state. This callback may modify the node\+\_\+transform and node\+\_\+state to apply an effective change to the render state at this level. Intended to be overridden by derived \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} types to return a unique number indicating whether this \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} is equivalent to the other one.

This should return 0 if the two \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} objects are equivalent, a number less than zero if this one should be sorted before the other one, and a number greater than zero otherwise.

This will only be called with two \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect} objects whose get\+\_\+type() functions return the same. Tells the \doxylink{classBamReader}{Bam\+Reader} how to create objects of type \doxylink{classTexProjectorEffect}{Tex\+Projector\+Effect}.
