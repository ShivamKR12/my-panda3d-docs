If the file represents a directory (that is, is\+\_\+directory() returns true), this returns the list of files within the directory at the current time. Returns NULL if the file is not a directory or if the directory cannot be read. If the file represents a directory, lists its contents. If the file represents a directory, recursively lists its contents and those of all subdirectories. Opens the file for reading. Returns a newly allocated istream on success (which you should eventually delete when you are done reading). Returns NULL on failure. Closes a file opened by a previous call to open\+\_\+read\+\_\+file(). This really just deletes the istream pointer, but it is recommended to use this interface instead of deleting it explicitly, to help work around compiler issues. Call this method after a reading the istream returned by open\+\_\+read\+\_\+file() to completion. If it returns true, the file was read completely and without error; if it returns false, there may have been some errors or a truncated file read. This is particularly likely if the stream is a Virtual\+File\+HTTP. Opens the file for writing. Returns a newly allocated ostream on success (which you should eventually delete when you are done writing). Returns NULL on failure.
