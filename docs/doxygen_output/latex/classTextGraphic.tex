\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This defines a special model that has been constructed for the purposes of embedding an arbitrary graphic image within a text paragraph.

It can be any arbitrary model, though it should be built along the same scale as the text, and it should probably be at least mostly two-\/ dimensional. Typically, this means it should be constructed in the X-\/Z plane, and it should have a maximum vertical (Z) height of 1.\+0.

The frame specifies an arbitrary bounding volume in the form (left, right, bottom, top). This indicates the amount of space that will be reserved within the paragraph. The actual model is not actually required to fit within this rectangle, but if it does not, it may visually overlap with nearby text. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
