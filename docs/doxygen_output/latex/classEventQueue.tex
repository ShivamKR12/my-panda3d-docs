\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A queue of pending events. As events are thrown, they are added to this queue; eventually, they will be extracted out again by an \doxylink{classEventHandler}{Event\+Handler} and processed. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
